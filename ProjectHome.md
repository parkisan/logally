A better description may be: Experimental tool to work with merged timestamped key-value stores.

The main idea behind it is to experiment with structured presenting of event data from multiple datasources in the same view (think log2timeline/plaso + enterprise-specific logs + network logs...)

This is in prealpha stage. At the moment you cannot set up visualization thorugh the UI, although through scripting it should work well.
